A time-domain data reduction pipeline (e.g., for handling images->lightcurves) for surveys like DECam and LS4


## Database schema

The database interactions are managed using SQLAlchemy's object-relational model (ORM). 
Each table is mapped to a python-side object, that can be added or deleted using a session object.

It is useful to get familiar with the naming convention for different pieces of data: 

- `Exposure`: a single exposure of a single CCD, linked to raw data on disk. 
- `Image`: a simple image, that has been processed to remove bias, dark, and flat fields.
  Each `Image` is linked to exactly one `Exposure`. 
- `CoaddImage`: a table similar to `Image` (using `ImageMixin`), but linked to a list of `Image`s 
  that were used to produce the coadd.  
- `SubtractionImage`: another table similar to `Image` (using `ImageMixin`), but linked to a new `Image` and 
  a `CoaddImage` that acts as a reference for the subtraction. 
- `Sighting`: a small region on a single image, where something interesting has been detected. 
  Each `Sighting` is linked to exactly one `Image`. The `Sighting` also contains a list of `Cutout` objects,
  a list of `Photometry` objects, and a many-to-one association to an `Object` table.  
- `Object`: a table that contains information about a single astronomical object (real or bogus), 
  such as its RA, Dec, and magnitude. Each `Object` is linked to a list of `Sighting`s. 
- `Cutouts`: contain the small pixel stamps around a point in the sky in one image, linked to a single `Sighting`.
  Will contain links to disk locations of three cutouts: the reference image, the new image, and the difference image.
- `Photometry`: contains measurements made on the information in the `Cutouts` for a single `Sighting`. 
  These include flux+errors, magnitude+errors, centroid positions, spot width, etc. 
- `Provenance`: A table containing the code version and critical parameters that are unique to this version of the data. 
  Each data product above must link back to a provenance row, so we can recreate the conditions that produced this data.
