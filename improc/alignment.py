        # it did, and had to think about it and dig through SWarp
        # documentation to figure out why it was doing what I wanted.
        #
        # SWarp will normally align a bunch of images to the first
        # image, cropping them, and summing them, which is more (and
        # less) than what we want.  In order to get it to align a single
        # image to another single image, we rely on behavior that's
        # mentioned almost as an afterthought in the SWarp manual: "To
        # implement the unusual output features required, one must write
        # a coadd.head ASCII file that contains a custom anisotropic
        # scaling matrix."  Practically speaking, we put the WCS that we
        # want the output image to have into <outim>.head.  SWarp will
        # then warp the input image so that the requested WCS will be
        # the right one for the warped image.
        #
        # We *could* just put the target image's WCS in the coadd.head
        # file, and then swarp the source image.  However, that spatial
        # transformation is the combination of two transformation
        # functions (from the source image to RA/Dec via its WCS, and
        # then from RA/Dec to the target image WCS).  It may be that the
        # Gaia WCSes we use nowadays are good enough for this, but we
        # can do better by making a *direct* transformation between the
        # two images.  To this end, we use the *source image's* source
        # list as the catalog, and use Scamp to calculate the
        # transformation necessary from the target image to the source
        # image.  The resultant WCS is now a WCS for the target image,
        # only it's using the RA/Decs calculated from the pixel
        # positions in the image's source list.  We then tell SWarp to
        # warp the source image so that it has this new WCS, and that
        # will warp the pixels so that they will give all the objects on
        # the source image the same RA/Dec that they have right now,
        # only using the WCS that was derived for the target
        # image... meaning the source image has been aligned with the
        # target image.  There is one more wrinkle: we have to tell
        # SWarp the shape of the output image, since it will default
        # to the shape of the input image.  But, we want it to have
        # the shape of the target image.
        #
        # (This mode of operation is not well-documented in the SWarp
        # manual, which assumes most people want to coadd with cropping,

        Parameters
        ----------
          source_image: Image
             An Image that will get warped.  Image must have
             already been through astrometric and photometric calibration.
             Will use the sources, wcs, and zp attributes attached to
             the Image object.

          target_image: Image
             An image to which the source_image will be aligned.
             Will use the sources and wcs fields attributes attached to
             the Image object.

        -------
          DataStore
            A new DataStore (that is not either of the input DataStores)
            whose image field holds the aligned image.  Extraction, etc.
