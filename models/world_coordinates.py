    # This is a little profligate.  There will eventually be millions of
    # images, which means that there will be gigabytes of header data
    # stored in the relational database.  (One header excerpt is about
    # 4k.)  It's not safe to assume we know exactly what keywords
    # astropy.wcs.WCS will produce, as there may be new FITS standard
    # extensions etc., and astropy doesn't document the keywords.
    #
    # Another option would be to parse all the keywords into a dict of {
    # string: (float or string) } and store them as a JSONB; that would
    # reduce the size pretty substantially, but it would still be
    # roughly a KB for each header, so the consideration is similar.
    # (It's also more work to implement....)
    #
    # Yet another option is to store the WCS in an external file, but
    # now we're talking something awfully small (a few kB) for this HPC
    # filesystems.
    #
    # Even yet another option that we won't do short term because it's
    # WAY too much effort is to have an additional nosql database of
    # some sort that is designed for document storage (which really is
    # what this is here).
    #
    # For now, we'll be profliate with the database, and hope we don't
    # regret it later.
