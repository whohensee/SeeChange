class Detector:
    """Extract sources (and possibly a psf) from images or subtraction images.

    There are a few different ways to get the sources from an image.
    The most common is to use SExtractor, which is the default we use for direct images.
    There is also "sep", which is a python-based equivalent (sort of) of SExtractor,
    but it is not fully compatible and not fully supported.
    Finally, you can use a matched-filter approach, meaning that you cross-correlate
    the image with the PSF and find everything above some threshold.
    There are some subtleties involved, like what to do if multiple pixels
    (connected or just close to each other) are above threshold.
    In some cases, like after running ZOGY, the image already contains a "score" image,
    which is just the normalized result of running a matched-filter.
    In that case, the "filter" method of this class will just use the score image
    instead of re-running PSF matched-filtering.

    It should also be noted that using the "filter" method does not find the PSF
    from the image (whereas the SExtractor method does). This is one of the main reasons
    SExtractor is used for detecting sources on the direct images.
    On the subtraction image, on the other hand, you can use the "filter" method
    and either use the PSF from ZOGY or just assume the subtraction image's PSF is
    the same as the direct image's PSF.

    This is also why when you use this class on the subtraction image, it will
    be initialized with pars.measure_psf=False.

    We distinguish between finding sources in a regular image, calling it "extraction"
    (we are extracting many sources of static objects, mostly) and finding sources
    in difference images, calling it "detection" (identifying transient sources that
    may or may not exist in an image). The pars.subtraction parameter is used to
    define a Detection object to use in either of these cases, with a completely
    different set of parameters for each object.

            "{FileOnDiskMixin.temp_path}/{tempname}.sources.fits".  It
            is the responsibility of the calling routine to delete this

            This routine writes some temp files with the image, weight,

            redundant with what's already written somewhere.  Normally,
            they're deleted at the end of the routine.  Set this to True
            to keep the files for debugging purposes.  (If tempname is
            not None, then the sourcelist file will not be deleted even
            if this is False; the reasoning is, if you passed a
            tempname, it's because you needed that file, and indeed

        ----------
        image: Image
            The image to extract sources from. Must have a score, or a PSF,
            that can be gotten from one of these places (in order):
            - a PSF object loaded on the Image object itself.
            - a zogy_psf attribute attached to the Image object.
            - a PSF object of the new_image attribute of the Image object.
            If the image also has a zogy_alpha attribute, it will be used
            to extract the PSF photometry.

        Returns
        -------
        sources: SourceList
            The list of sources detected in the image.
            This contains a table where each row represents
            one source that was detected, along with all its properties.
