            A PSF object.  Ignored if measure_psf is True.  If passed,

            sizes, and will be used for PSF photometry.

            10, 14, 20) pixels.)  The "primary" aperture should be the
            first one on the list.

          image: Image
            The Image object from which to extract.  This routine will
            use all of image, weight, and flags data.

          apers: list of float
            Aperture radii in pixels in which to do aperture photometry.

          psffile: Path or str, or None
            File that has the PSF to use for PSF photometry.  If None,
            won't do psf photometry.

          tempname: str
            If not None, a filename base for where the catalog will be
            written.  The source file will be written to
            "{FileOnDiskMixin.temp_path}/{tempname}.sources.fits".  It
            is the responsibility of the calling routine to delete this
            temporary file.  In any event, a number of temporary files
            will be created and deleted inside this routine (image,
            weight, mask), all of which will also be deleted by this
            routine unless do_not_cleanup is True.  If tempname is None,
            the sources file will also be automatically deleted; only if
            it is not None is the calling routine always responsible for
            deleting it.

          do_not_cleanup: bool, default False
            This routine writes some temp files with the image, weight,
            mask, and sourcelist data in it, much of which is probably
            redundant with what's already written somewhere.  Normally,
            they're deleted at the end of the routine.  Set this to True
            to keep the files for debugging purposes.  (If tempname is
            not None, then the sourcelist file will not be deleted even
            if this is False; the reasoning is, if you passed a
            tempname, it's because you needed that file, and indeed
            extract_sources_sextractor does.)

          psf_size: int or None
            The size of one side of the thumbnail of the PSF, in pixels.
            Should be odd; if it's not, 1 will be added to it.

            created on the way to building the PSF that's returned.
