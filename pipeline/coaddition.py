    Each image should have a PSF and a ZeroPoint associated with it (and loaded!) when running coaddition.

    Images are expected to be aligned (use the Aligner) and should generally be of the same sky region.
    If not already aligned, they need to have the SourceList and WorldCoordinates loaded so that
    alignment can be done on the fly.

    Input images should also have a valid Provenance associated with them. Not that for any set of images
    that share a provenance hash, their respective downstreams (e.g., PSF) should also have a single provenance
    hash for each type of downstream.  This makes it possible to identify the upstream images' associated products
    based solely on the provenance's upstream hashes.

    Areas on the edges where the images are not overlapping (or bad pixels, etc.) are coadded but will
    contribute zero weight, so the total weight of that pixel will be zero (if all input images have a bad pixel)
    or they would have lower weight if only some images had bad pixels there.

    Remember that some coaddition methods use convolution with the PSF, so any effects of individual pixels
    could affect nearby pixels, depending on the size of the PSF.

        The possible input types are:
        - unamed arguments that are all Image objects, to be treated as self.images
        - a list of Image objects, assigned into self.images
        - two lists of Image objects, the second one is a list of aligned images matching the first list,
          such that the two lists are assigned to self.images and self.aligned_images
        - start_time + end_time + instrument + filter + section_id + provenance_id + RA + Dec (or target)

        To pass the latter option, must use named parameters.
        An optional session can be given, either as one of the named
        or unnamed args, and it will be used throughout the pipeline
        (and left open at the end).

        The start_time and end_time can be floats (interpreted as MJD)
        or strings (interpreted by astropy.time.Time(...)), or None.
        If end_time is not given, will use current time.
        If start_time is not given, will use end_time minus the
        coaddition pipeline parameter date_range.
        The provenance_ids can be None, which will use the most recent "preprocessing" provenance.
        Can also provide a list of provenance_ids or a single string.
        The coordinates can be given as either float (decimal degrees) or strings
        (sexagesimal hours for RA and degrees for Dec).
        Can leave coordinates empty and provide a "target" instead (i.e., target
        will be used as the "field identifier" in the survey).

        In either case, the output is a list of Image objects.
        Each image is checked to see if it has the related products
        (SourceList, PSF, WorldCoordinates, ZeroPoint).
        If not, it will raise an exception. If giving these images directly
        (i.e., not letting the pipeline load them from DB) the calling scope
        must make sure to load those products first.
