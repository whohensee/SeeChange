    # Can also use ra_int and ra_frac to get the integer number before/after the decimal point
    # (the same can be done for dec). Also use ra_int_h to get the number in hours.
    # to get the declination with "p" or "m" replacing the sign, use dec_int_pm.

# DECam

# For the observatory-supplied calibrations, NOIRLab distributes them on
# a Google Drive, which is a nightmare to try to download
# programmatically.  What's more, they come in ginormous tar files,
# which are slow to process; especially for tests, where we just want to
# do a couple of chips, it's not worth the time.  So, I've untarred the
# files on the NERSC web portal to allow them to be grabbed
# individually.  These can be found on Perlmutter at
# /global/cfs/dirs/m2218/www/decam_calibration_files
