# Customizing the config
#
# Do not edit this file, so that it will stay synced with what's in the
# git archive.  (The tests also depend on what's in here.)  To change
# values, the YAML files given in "overrides" will replace any values
# here with what's there.  The YAML files given in "augments" will not
# replace anything, but if there are new values (e.g. in dictionaries)
# that aren't present here, they will be added.
#
# WARNING : python's yaml reading is broken.  It will read 1e10 as a
# string, not a float.  Write 1.0e+10 to make it work right.  There are
# two things here: the first is the + after e (which, I think *is* part
# of the yaml spec, even though we can freely omit that + in Python and
# C).  The second is the decimal point; the YAML spec says it's not
# necessary, but python won't recognize it as a float without it.

# Local file storage
#
# format: string
#   Format for image files.  Currently only "fits" and "fitsfz" are
#   supported.  We have vague ambitions to support HDF5 files.  ASDF has
#   only very vaguely been considered by one person.
#
# single_file: bool
#   If True, then weight, flags will be stored in the same file with the
#   image data (as different HDU extensions for FITS files).  If False,
#   then image, weight, flags are three separate FITS files.
#   single_file=True is not really fully supported at the moment, and
#   would need some development and a bunch of thought before one should
#   trust using it.
#
# name_convention: string
#   Use any of the following: inst_name, date, time, section_id, filter,
#   ra, dec, prov_id.  Can also use section_id_int if the section_id is
#   always an integer.  Can also use ra_int and ra_frac to get the integer
#   number before/after the decimal point (the same can be done for
#   dec).  Also use ra_int_h to get the number in hours, etc.  To get the
#   declination with "p" or "m" replacing the sign, use dec_int_pm.  The
#   string given here is fed into the python format() function so you
#   can use e.g., {ra_int:03d} to get a 3 digit zero padded right
#   ascension.  The name convention can also include subfolders (e.g.,
#   using {ra_int}/...).  The minimal set of fields to make the
#   filenames unique include: inst_name (short instrument name), date,
#   time, section_id, prov_hash (in this example, the first six
#   characters of the provenance unique hash)

#
#   verify_cert: bool
#     Should we verify the SSL cert of the archive server?  You usually

#     false so we don't have to deal with getting certificates for
#     our internally contained docker environment.
#
#   path_base: string
#     The base of the collection on the archive server (a string unique
#     to this dataset).  (This is not a full path, but relative to the
#     base of the overall archive, and will usually just be a single
#     word.)
#
#   local_read_dir: string or null
#     The directory to read from if the archive is on the local
#     filesystem, or null.  Different from local_write_dir in case
#     the system has a faster read-only method of accessing the same
#     files (which is the case on NERSC).  If null, then the archive
#     is not accessible locally, and the archive_url server will be
#     used instead.  May be the same as local_write_dir.
#
#   local_write_dir: string or null
#     The directory to write to if the archive is on the local

#
#   password: string
#     The password for authentication on the conductor.

#     you have a secure "secrets" directory where you keep passwords,
#     so that you don't have to put the password in an actual
