    # The convention for building filenames for images
    # Use any of the following: short_name, date, time, section_id, filter, ra, dec, prov_id
    # Can also use section_id_int if the section_id is always an integer
    # Can also use ra_int and ra_frac to get the integer number before/after the decimal point
    # (the same can be done for dec). Also use ra_int_h to get the number in hours.
    # to get the declination with "p" or "m" replacing the sign, use dec_int_pm.
    # The string given here is fed into the python format() function
    # so you can use e.g., {ra_int:03d} to get a 3 digit zero padded right ascension.
    # The name convention can also include subfolders (e.g., using {ra_int}/...).
    # The minimal set of fields to make the filenames unique include:
    # inst_name (short instrument name), date, time, section_id, prov_hash
    # (in this example, the first six characters of the provenance unique hash)
